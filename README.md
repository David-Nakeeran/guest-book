## Reflection

- Achieved all requirement and stretch goals

- I had originally wanted to take this project a lot further. It was going to be a quest board, with a users table linked to a quests table. It would require users to register and login, they then would be able to create quests, which other others could attempt to complete based on a die roll. I was also thinking about a reputation system as well (trying to incorporating a like system)...but none of this happened.

- Styling takes me a long time!
